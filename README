This is tunnel, a personal proxy program which lets you monitor how much time you
effectively spend on various websites.

To run it, just type "./tunnel"

How does it compute the time spent ?

To compute how much time you have spent on a website, tunnel uses a simple 
heuristic : it considers that you're actively surfing a website if you're
clicking on link on the same domain every five minutes
